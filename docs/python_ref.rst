    .. method:: add_rnase_site(name, start, stop, rate)

        Define an Rnase cleavage site.
        
        :param name: A unique identifier for this RNase cleavage site.
        :type name: string
        :param start: Start position of RNase cleavage site.
        :type start: int
        :param stop: Stop position of RNase cleavage site.
        :type stop: int
        :param rate: Binding rate constant between RNase and this cleavage site.
        :type rate: float

        .. note::

            The internal RNase binding rate constant can alternatively be supplied as an 
            argument during Genome initialization (see ``Genome`` class description above).
            In this case, ``add_rnase_site()`` will only accept values for start and stop,
            and all rnase binding sites will be initialized with the same rate constant.
